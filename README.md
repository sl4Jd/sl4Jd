Fluent in English and Serbian  

I am 19 year old electrical engineering student with interest in computer science, mathematicians and space.

## Programming
Most of my projects are in. C++ and range from graphics programming to computational experiments for number theory.

I also use Rust but for now only for emulators.
Currently learning Lean to help me conquer field of number theory.

As for setup i use Arch Linux with hyprland and VS code as text editor.

## Other STEM
As i said i have big interest in math. Currently main areas are number and graph theory, but i want to delve into geometry, specifically algebraic geometry and topology.

As i am Electrical engineering student, that is where big chunk of my focus is. Main area for my is Signal processing.

I am also intrigued by sheer vastness of space and specifically interstellar space.

Hopefully i will one day be able to unite my areas of interests into one singular project/research.

## Interest outside science
