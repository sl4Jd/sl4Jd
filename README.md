I also use Rust but for now only for emulators. <br>
Currently learning Lean to help me conquer field of number theory. <br>
As for setup i use Arch Linux with hyprland and VS code as text editor. <br>
## Other STEM
As i said i have big interest in math. Currently main areas are number and graph theory, but i want to delve into geometry, specifically algebraic geometry and topology. <br>
As i am Electrical engineering student, that is where big chunk of my focus is. Main area for my is Signal processing. <br>

Hopefully i will one day be able to unite my areas of interests into one singular project/research. <br>
